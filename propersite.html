We can't wait to meet you at our first class this Saturday, January 20th!

Welcome to OK Coders! Below you'll find the final details for module 1 of the 2018 OK Coders beginner track in OKC. Our first class is this Saturday, January 20th, from 9am-1pm. 

Location. OK Coders will take place at 865 Research Parkway on OU's Research Park, just east of downtown Oklahoma City. Once you arrive, come to the third floor of the building and you'll find signage directing you to the classroom. Please arrive 10-15 minutes early if possible to accommodate for parking, finding the classroom, connecting to the wifi, and troubleshooting.

Parking. There are 2-hr parking spots directly in front of the building which you are welcome to use (parking rules not enforced on Saturdays), as well as a visitors lot just across the street from the building. Do NOT park in the parking garage. 

Setup. You will need a few pieces of software for class, all of which are free. You can view instructions for installing these tools at the OK Coders Github repository. Please take a stab at getting these installed before the first class. If you run into any issues or have questions, feel free to email okcoders@gmail.com. 

If you want extra pre-work, get started on the right foot by reviewing Codecademy's lessons for Web Fundamentals (HTML/CSS).

		Equipment. You will need to bring your own laptop with you to class, as we do not provide computers for our participants. If this is a problem for you, let us know ASAP so we can help find a solution.
